Build week 8 has begun.

This week will mostly be attaching Hazel spars around and around the roof in preparation for 
being able to add thatch to the roof.

This is going to require:

* A lot of team work
* A head for heights
* Many dozens of square lashings

{{<figure src="../roof-spars-2.jpg" caption="The square lashing needs a team-based approach to apply it in these awkward spaces and angles.">}}

Everything seems to get off to a great start and the roof structure begins to take shape. 

But no sooner than said stuff starts to go wrong.

It all seems to be that as a group we have exactly zero experience of using sisal and this is our downfall.

* It is incredibly harsh and will tear flesh really easily - work gloves are a must, but wearing them makes forming the lashing awkward
* It seems that the sisal needs to be stretched prior to use, by about 15%, or it becomes slack shortly after you think your beautiful lashing is complete
* We can't decide what effect moisture has on the cord and the lashing. We conduct various experiments, pre-wetting, pre-stretching, wetting and stretching, wetting after use etc. All that really happens is we get really confused
* The cut ends of the cord unravel into their individual fibres almost as soon as you turn away. We have to ensure that we 
  "whip" the cut ends the instant they are cut. We use Common Whipping (again thanks RYA) and make whipping cord from
  pieces of sisal that have already unravelled.

After 2 or 3 days of trying, tying and re-tying, the technique that seemed to bring the most desirable 
and repeatable results wa:

* New, dry cord
* Building up the lashing slowly and neatly 
* Using mechanical leverage (an Oak Peg) to take the strecth out of the just applied cord on every quarter turn of the lashing. Just using upper body strength alone is not nearly enough force
 
This does slow down the tying of 
each lashing and means that a two and sometime three man team is required at each lashing point. 
It also means that 
the lashing stays tight and does not slacken off a couple of hours later on, which is 
more than compensation for the slower pace.

I wish we had found this formula earlier on as we now face more than 100 lashings to re-do on all the lower levels of the roof.

Edwin's hewn oak gate and archway is completed. Edwin has avoided saws, nails and other forms of modern witchery in its manufacture. He has used only Bronze Axes,
Adzes and Chisels; oh and wooden tools (e.g. a mallet) that he made.

On Thursday we were visited by the BBC who interviewed Luke Winter (the Project Leader), Caroline and I. I believe 
the interviews will be edited into a segment to be broadcast on BBC North West Today sometime or other.

This week's weather has been both drenching (rain) and scorching (full sun) all in the same day. 
Several times this has 
caught me out
by me forgetting to re-apply sunscreen after the rain has 
washed my previous application into the dirt. So by the end of 
the week I am afraid I was doing a full-on lobster red complexion.

Build Week 8 done. Nothing more now until June.
