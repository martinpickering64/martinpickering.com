# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security issues and bugs should be reported privately by emailing secure@martinpickering.com. 
You should receive a response within 48 hours. 
If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

We do not operate a bug bounty scheme. Please don't demand any bounty.

Please do not open issues for anything you think might have a security implication.
