Today saw the Beeston Castle Roundhouse Project get underway. The first activity was for the 
Core Build Team:

* to be inducted into English Heritage
* to receive Health and Safety, First Aid and Fire Safety Training
* introduced to the Beeston Castle Site, layout and history

We were also introduced to Luke Winter of [Historic Concepts](https://historicconcepts.co.uk/). 

Luke is our Project Leader, instructor and font of all Bronze Age, archaeological and ancient building technology knowledge.

During our induction we were shown the site for the Roundhouse, which has been partially cleared in 
preparation for the project getting underway.

The photo above shows Carolyn Hicks of English Heritage, our Volunteer Co-ordinator, standing dead centre of 
the roundhouse. Barely discernable are two circles darwn on the ground: the inner circle marks the wall of 
the house and the outer one the extent of the eaves. So, it ain't gonna be small house then!

The photo above shows that some of the timber gathering has also begun with a few Oak Trees collected,
snedded and awaiting further processing. It looks like three of these are destined to become the 
tallest, central roof supports.

Finally, we were given one piece of disappointing news. The Project has been delayed. This is 
because final planning permission from CWAC has not yet arrived. Until it does, no further 
work can begin.
