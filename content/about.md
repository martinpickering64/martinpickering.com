Hey there,

I'm Martin Pickering, partner to [Caroline Gregson](https://www.carolinegregson.com/ "Caroline's website") and father of Sean.

I earn my keep as a Code Monkey, mostly with [Positive Solutions Ltd](https://positive-solutions.co.uk/ "Positive Solutions Ltd") at the moment. I'm also sometimes known as a [Beekeeper](https://www.devabees.com/ "it's all about the bees"), a Woodland Manager and a [builder of ancient roundhouses](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/beeston-castle-and-woodland-park/beeston-roundhouse/ "one I made earlier").
