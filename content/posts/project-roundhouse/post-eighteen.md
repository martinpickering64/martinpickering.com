I return to the Beeston Castle Bronze Age Roundhouse Project having 
missed the previous Build Week due to ill health.

My fellow Build Team members all seem to think that my absence was down to an excessive
dislike of thatching. Not true!

Well the dislike part is true. But that was not why I missed Build Week 11.

I didn't remember to take any photographs this week and so that puts me in a bit of a 
bind with regards to what to put in this Post. Fortunately, Caroline and Dave Trevor 
came to my rescue with some pictures they took.

Summary for the week:

* More thatching, so very nearly done now
* we had visitors, our first school party
* we had more visitors, various people from other parts of English Heritage came to play
* Bracken was harvested with a view to a little roofing experiment on the Roundhouse Annexe

Did you say annexe? Yes, I did.

Dave Trevor came up with the idea that one area of the roof with especially long roof beams and a very ameniable
arrangement of the wall posts could be viewed as and so made into a little annexe. So we all said why not!

We also decided that as the roof for the annexe would not be a continuation of the main roof and 
because it was limited in size we could indulge in a little experimentation. So, we have decided to roof the 
annexe using a material that Beeston Castle has an excess of. Namely, Bracken.
