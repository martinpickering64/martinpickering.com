So its Build Week 5, let's do this!


{{<figure src="../larch-logs.jpg" caption="A quantity of Larch Logs has arrived at the site.">}}

We figure that these will be good for furniture and other building interior projects to help dress the set of the completed Roundhouse.

We've taken a further delivery of Oak Logs to complete what ought to be needed for the Wall Plate or ring beam.

This means more bark stripping, obviously.

This time around though the oak isn't so green. Apparently, it's been down for more than a year. 
Result: The wood is as hard as a very hard thing. 

> Oh my hands, my arms, my back.

All of the Wall Posts have now been put into their positions.

Lots of angles to account for, lengths to measure, mortices and tenons to fashion. 

We made a concious decision that 
certain parts of the building would only be worked using Bronze Tools, whilst other parts could be touched 
by either Bronze or Steel Tools. Those parts nearest the camera, from where the nearest scaffold is positioned and 
then clockwise for about 1/3 of the ring were selected as the Bronze only areas.

After this week's labour, significant progress has been made.
