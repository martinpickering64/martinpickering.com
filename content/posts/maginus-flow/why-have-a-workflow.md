> Definition: A Git Workflow is a recipe for how to use Git to accomplish work in a consistent and productive manner. 

A Git Workflow encourage developers to use Git effectively and consistently. Git offers a lot 
of flexibility as to how developers manage assets and changes to those assets. Given 
Git's focus on flexibility, there is no standardized process on how to interact with Git 
defined by Git. When working with a team on a Git managed project, it is important to make sure 
the team is in agreement on how the flow of changes will be applied. To ensure that
the team is in agreement, a Git Workflow policy should be developed or selected. There are several 
publicised Git Workflows, each have their specific advantage and drawbacks and suit (or do not suit) 
particular applications and circumstances.

The list of possible workflows makes it hard to know where to begin when implementing Git in 
the workplace. This series of Posts sets out the Git Workflow we use at Maginus and why we have not simply 
adopted one of the published Git Workflow suggestions.
