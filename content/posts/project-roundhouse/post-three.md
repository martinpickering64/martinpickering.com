Great news today, Planning Permission from CWAC has arrived. So, we can begin Project Roundhouse.

The planning is conditional on us providing commitments for additional habitat 
restoration activities for Birds and Bats as a part of the work. No problem.

Due in part to the delays, the project schedule has had to be redrafted. This means 
that the agreement that I had negotiated with Maginus (my employer) for my sabatical 
time off is a pile of rubbish. New negotiations based on the new plan have begun.

Fingers crossed.
