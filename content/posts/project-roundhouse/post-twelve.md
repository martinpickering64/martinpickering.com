After a short break for Easter etc., we are back with Build Week 7.

Not strictly Roundhouse news, but who cares. Peregrine Falcons have been 
found to be nesting once again high up and inaccessible on Beeston Crag. We are 
all very excited to be vicarious parents.

The main focus for this week is the roof. We are adding Roof Beams (or rafters?) to our house.
This means those 28 8m Ash Poles we prepared over the previous Build Weeks can now find 
their proper home and purpose.

This also means a further batch of (larger) Oak Pegs are required. Whilst we are putting a small bird's mouth
into the Ash Poles where they connect with the Wall and Roof Plates, we have decided that the further addition of
a tapered peg is in order. Our mini industrial peg manufacturing set-up from our last build week is therefore needed again this week.

Along with the Peg, a bit of Square Lashing with Sisal Cord completes the fixing. I knew that RYA Coastal 
Skipper qualification would come in useful one day.

Edwin Wood has also started a side project of his own. He has (rightly) decided that the entrance to our Roundhouse 
site needs to be much improved. So he has designed a Gateway and Arch fit for a Bronze Age Chieftan. 
And it is now well under way.

Very disappointingly our Team Cabin has been broken into during the course of this week. The three misunderstood 
individuals who perpetrated the crime wrote off one of the walls and the door to the cabin in order to obtain:

* a pair of push to talk radios
* the Project's Tablet PC, which contained all of our Project's records - fortunately backed up to the iCloud
* 3.5 litres of semi-skimmed milk
* and all my Bourbon Biscuits!

Fortunately, our tools and bronze castings were not in the cabin.

A second crime occurred before the end of the week as a jolly lad helped themsleves 
to a large sculpture of an Owl from outside
of the Beeston Castle Visitor Centre. They were seen on CCTV wheelbarrowing the chain sawn 
sculpture off down the lane.

On a happier note, we also managed to get all of the Roof Beams up and into position.

Here's a quick video cataloguing site activity for Build Week 7. It gives a flavour of 
all that has been going on.

Let's finish with a bit more of Dave Trevor's photography...
