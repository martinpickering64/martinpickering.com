Dave Trevor is a fellow Core Team member of the Beeston Castle Roundhouse Team. He 
runs a business, along with his partner Chris, that supplies workshops and demonstrations
for schools in the North West aimed at improving understanding of our 
Palaeolithic prehistory. [10,000 Years BC](https://www.10000yearsbc.co.uk/)

Turns out he also quite a talented photographer. Here are some of his snaps taken 
during our first 3 Build Weeks. Enjoy!
