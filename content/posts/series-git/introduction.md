__I have never used GIT before.__

Yep, there I have said it. I have not used GIT before now. Of course I have used Version Control 
Systems for many years, but they have tended to be the ones distributed by Microsoft. As a Developer
primarily involved in software based upon or using Microsoft Products, working for Microsoft Partners
and being an MCSD, why wouldn't I?

But just recently I have experienced one too many Branch and Merge nightmares with MSTFS and I am getting 
way too old for this sort of rubbish. Hence, I am going to take charge of my destiny (_in this regard_) 
and learn GIT. If successful then I also intend to swap over all of my Projects, Products and Software
Development Teams as well.

When considering how I would go about learning GIT I decided upon the following:

- I need a project or two of substance upon which I can practice, but not ones of a critical nature 
  such that if it all goes wrong I would be overly bothered; so that will be a couple of my pro-bono websites I think
- I am going to write down via a series of Posts on this website stuff about GIT that I learn or that I need to retain; 
  so, it will become my own personal refernce repository of things GIT important to me.
