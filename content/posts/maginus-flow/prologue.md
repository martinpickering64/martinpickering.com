To the question: "What Version Control System (VCS) do we use at Maginus?"

The answer is: "We use Git".

Great. Everybody knows Git, right? So that's sorted and we can just get on with the enjoyable task of creating great software.

> NO!

Everybody who knows Git also knows that:

1.	Git is just a collection of concepts and an assemblage of Tools (client-side and server-side)
2.	A collaborating Git Team has first to agree upon, and then abide by, a set of rules, 
    practices and conventions as to how they are to interact with Git in order not to make a 
	mess of things and to achieve their long term goals efficiently and effectively; this is 
	known as their adopted Git Workflow

So, "What is the Git Workflow Maginus has adopted?"
 
> Good, now that is the right question

Answer: Maginus Flow. And this is a series of posts that will describe it.
