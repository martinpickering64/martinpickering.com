English Heritage has begun to make and publish YouTubes about their
Bronze Age Roundhouse recreation at Beeston Castle.

This first video is squarely aimed at getting the interest of school groups
to come to the Castle and visit the Roundhouse.

This video has many scenes filmed in and around the Roundhouse and was
filmed after the commissioning of the Hearth so shows the interior with
a lit fire. It seems to be billed as part of series although only 
one episode exists; so far.
