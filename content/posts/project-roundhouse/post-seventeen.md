Disaster.

I came down with some sort of viral infection and I miss the entire Build Week.

Some said it was because I didn't like thatching, and they do have a point; I don't. 
But nevertheless, that was not the reason!

So I am afraid I don't have much to say about this Build Week as I have zero first hand information to impart.
