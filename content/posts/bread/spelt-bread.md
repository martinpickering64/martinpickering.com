A Spelt Loaf made with a little whole-grain wheat flour to help make the dough a little more manageable and the results somewhat more consistent.

* 350g Whole-grain Spelt Flour
* 150g Whole-grain Wheat Flour
* 2tsp salt
* 7g Fast Acting Bread Yeast
* 350ml Water

Combine the ingredients in a Mason Bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes.

Stretch and fold the dough. Allow it to rest for 30 minutes and stretch and fold once again.

Allow to ferment for 45 minutes to an hour (_depending on temperature_).

Turn out the dough and pre-shape. Allow it to rest on the counter for 15 to 20 minutes.

Perform the final shape and leave on a peel to rise once more.

Score the loaf and bake in 200C pre-heated oven (_steam is optional_) for 30 to 40 minutes.

Place on a wire rack to cool and then eat.

### Postscript

I have been told that Spelt and Rye make a nice combination in a loaf. I have not tried it as Rye flour has not been available for me. One day, maybe.

I have also used Spelt in Sourdough Loaves. The result is very tasty, but it is a tricky dough to work with. The transition from proofed to over-proofed is very rapid and irreversible (_for me_).
