On the 26th and 27th October, Beeston Castle hosted a Public Daubing Event. Any of the 
Castle's Visitors could decide to become a Bronze Age Builder for the day and 
have a go at making and then applying Daub to the walls of the Bronze Age
Roundhouse. It was also an excuse for the members of the Build Team to get 
together once more at the site of their past year's labours.

There was a steady stream of visitors and unsurprisingly the smaller children were very keen
to get their hands in the mud and throw it at the walls. Parents and especially teenagers 
were not so keen.
