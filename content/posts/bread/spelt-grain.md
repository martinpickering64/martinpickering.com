The history of Spelt is long and involved. 

It is a species of wheat that is likely to be a naturally occurring hybrid of Emmer Wheat and wild goat-grass. Genetic evidence hints at the hybridisation taking place in the Middle East, probably more than 8,000 years ago. There is recent DNA evidence that would indicate that European Spelt might have a separate origin to the Near-Eastern Spelt.

Whole-grain Spelt may be nutritionally better because it contains more protein, essential amino acids, vitamins, and minerals than whole-grain wheat.

However, just like modern wheat, Spelt contains phytic acid, which can impair the absorption of essential nutrients. This may be a problem for people who are on a vegan or vegetarian diet, especially those deficient in certain vitamins. Soaking, sprouting, or fermenting Spelt can help lower phytic acid levels.

Spelt does contain all of the things that people with Gluten Intolerance and Irritable Bowel Syndrome find problematic. As such Spelt Bread should be avoided just the same as Bread from modern wheat.

That said it makes tasty bread. Although Spelt dough can be trickier to manage as it does not seem able to develop the same dough-strength as dough made with modern wheat. The Romans called bread made from Spelt "marching loaves" due to its energy giving properties. If you get a Spelt loaf wrong then the resultant flat, dense bread is tough enough to be marched over!
