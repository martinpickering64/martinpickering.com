Build week 9 is all about finishing the roof structure, starting out on the thatching and the walls.

Now that we understood how to effectively attach the hazel spars onto the 
roof using our sisal square lashings, we were able to progress with the roof much faster.

We took delivery of the Water Reed bundles that we would be using 
as thatching material for our roof. We have no idea or evidence as to what our Beeston Castle Bronze Age
counterparts would have used as roofing materials. We believe that the surrounding areas would have been very marshy
land and so the use of Reed or Rush is a definite possibility. 

Our reed came from somewhere in eastern europe. I'm
not sure why, but something was mentioned about availability and price.

{{<figure src="../thatch-delivery.jpg" caption="This is just one-third of the delivery. There was a second, fully loaded trailer with more bales of water reed.">}}

Exciting as the thatch delivery was, it then dawns on us that all of these thatch bundles aren't going to carry themselves
from Beeston Castle Showground up the hill to the Roundhouse. And so, the task begins of moving the bundles up the hill.
Some of the bundles have been damaged or come loose during transport and so need to be re-assembled and re-tied before we dare 
attempt to move them. This is going to be a long job.

As well as working on the roof, work has also begun on the walls. 

We don't know what the Beeston Castle Bronze Age 
Roundhouses would have had for walls. Again no evidence. But evidence from other sites indicate that wattle and daub 
was used for some buildings. Wattle and daud is what we are going to do.

{{<figure src="../more-wall.jpg" caption="Another view of our partially completed wattle walls. Question: should there be windows?">}}

Once we have completed the application of the Hazel spars to the roof and we have attached 
the first part of the thatch, the thatch roll (_the big bolster affair on the eaves_), we decide to have a break and a quick team photo.

{{<figure src="../thatch-going-on.jpg" caption="So, now we can start to thatch">}}

From our first applications of thatch it seems that we are going to need 3 bundles of reed per horizontal
meter and each row will gain us 30cm of height. We sat down to calculate the total number of bundles of thatch
we were going to need at this rate. Several headaches later we decided that
that was a lot of thatch and we had best crack on!

{{<figure src="../out-of-the-rain.jpg" caption="The fine weather we have enjoyed throught out May has now come to an end. But at least we have provided ourselves with some shelter.">}}

Let's finish off with a little video of what has been going on this week.
