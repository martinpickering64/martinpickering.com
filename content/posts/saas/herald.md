***This project is suspended for the time being.***

I have elected to use the name "Herald" for my SAAS Starter Kit project.

I *mostly* arrived at this name having looked at the definition of herald in the [Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/herald "")

*to be a sign that something important, and often good, is starting to happen*

Well, we can always have a bit of ambition, eh?

The GitHub Repository can be found at [https://github.com/martinpickering64/herald](https://github.com/martinpickering64/herald "https://github.com/martinpickering64/herald"). But be aware it is very empty at the moment as I am still at the planning and researching stages.
