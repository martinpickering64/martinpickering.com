[Storm Arwen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Arwen) was a thing!

My experience bears no comparison to those of many people around the country and for who I have the utmost sympathy. Nevertheless it is an event I shall remember for a good while.

At home we were lucky, just a bit of lead flashing and a few broken small branches.

At Round Wood there was damage done. Fortunately, nothing that constituted an emergency. In other words, nothing that fell across roads footpaths or across the woodland's boundaries. The casualty list was:

* Silver Birch - 9 mature trees and 2 veteran trees
* Ash - 3 mature trees
* Sycamore - 1 veteran tree
* Oak - 3 mature trees
* Hazel - 7 stools
* Cherry - 3 mature trees

Most of the Hazel casualties were as a result of large branches and trees falling on top of them in our coppice with standards areas.

The Oaks were a surprise. In reality, it was one large Oak that uprooted itself and took out neighbouring trees as it fell. Oak, Ash and Hazel were all collateral damage.

None of the standing dead wood fell. I take this to mean that as Arwen struck before most of the trees had lost their leaf canopy it was that additional weight that made the trees vulnerable.

I don't think much of the fallen lumber is going to be useful as timber. I hope that I'll be able to find some out of the Oak and I know that I can use some of the Ash for tool handles. In fact, I can use some Ash for my Christmas present from Sean; a bronze-age replica of a Palstave Axehead made by [Dr. James Dilley](https://www.ancientcraft.co.uk/). ![Replica Bronze Age Palstave Axehead](/images/palstaveaxehead.jpg "Bronze Axehead")

What I can't use for timber will go towards heating our house and Caroline's Studio for the next few years.
