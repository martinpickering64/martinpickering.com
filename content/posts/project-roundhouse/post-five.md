The Project schedule has been set out into 14 Build Weeks. These Build Weeks are spread
between February 2019 through to the end of September 2019. This week sees the first of 
these Build Weeks get underway and our first opportunity as a Project Team to get 
together since our induction back in the New Year.

So here is the Plan...

And here are some of the tools we will be using...

The objective for week 1 is to coalesce the team, be trained in site safety, safe use 
of the tools and safe materials handling. With that underway we can then begin to 
practice and develop skills in the use of our tools by starting the task of preparing 
the timbers that have been gathered and brought to site.

This will involve 

* establishing the work areas, 
* making tools like mauls and mallets
* hafting the bronze axes, adzes and chisels onto the handles we make
* making a legion of wooden wedges
* in order to split logs to begin making work benches, 
* and peeling the bark and outer cambium layers off of the construction timber starting with the roof and wall posts.

{{<figure src="../more-splitting.jpg" caption="When you thought you had done, there is always more to do. More splitting of logs.">}}

{{<figure src="../moving-moving-moving.jpg" caption="Until we really understand what we are doing and how we are going to work, there seems to be a lot of moving stuff around. Moving from being in the way here to being in the way over there!">}}

On Day 5, an inevitable winter storm blew its way in and the high winds meant 
that Beeston Castle had to remain closed. So no work done that day.
