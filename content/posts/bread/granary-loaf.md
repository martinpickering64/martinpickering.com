This is not a sourdough recipe as it uses conventional fast action bread yeast to leaven the bread. It is my favorite bread to have with cheese.

* 500g Granary or Malted Wheat flour
* 25ml Rapeseed Oil
* 1.25tsp salt
* 1.25tsp fast action bread yeast
* 275ml water
* 2tsp sugar (_optional_)

Combine the ingredients and leave to stand for 10 to 15 minutes.

Knead the rested dough. Return to the Mason Bowl and cover with a tea towel.

Allow the dough to rise for an hour or so (_temperature dependent_).

Turn out the dough and pre-shape. Leave uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes.

Final shape the dough into a baton on a peel. Or, place the pre-shaped and rested dough into a greased 500g/2lb loaf tin. Leave to rise for 30 to 40 minutes.

Bake in a pre-heated 230C oven on a pizza stone or a pre-heated baking tray for 30 to 35 minutes. Steam is optional.

The optional sugar will add to the flavour and make for a thicker crust. Sometimes, when I am in the mood, and when I have some, I will substitute the sugar for 1tbs of Malt Extract. The Malt Extract adds even more flavour and creates a richer, darker colour for the crumb.
