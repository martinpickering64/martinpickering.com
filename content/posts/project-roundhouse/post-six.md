Build Week 2 underway.

The size of the task before us begins to dawn on us. Having had several 
days last time stripping bark, we have had more timbers delivered and they have 
added considerably to the "_awaiting bark stripping_" pile. Not only that, we 
have discovered that our first efforts were not nearly good enough and so we have to 
revisit all of those _finished_ logs and finish them off as well.

The other main task for this week is to amend the Post Holes. Whilst they are all in the places 
intended, due to the discoveries about the ground conditions the structural engineer as advised
that they need to be made much deeper than they currently are. As the project is now underway, 
this will have to be undertaken using hand tools only.

If you have ever visited Beeston Castle then you will know that the Parkland is one very big hill. Given the Roundhouse is 
situated about 2/3rds of the way up the hill, the journey back and forth is going to help get us all much fitter. But as 
daily commutes go, it is novel, interesting and very pretty.

The Core Build Team is about 14 or so people who have committed to working on all 14 Build Weeks. There is a second wave of
volunteers who have made a commitment to regularly come and help build, maybe 2 or so days each build week. 
We have called these the Occaisional Builders. Then there are 
even more who don't want to work on the build but do want to work "fron of house" with the visitors to Beeston Castle
ofering assistance and interpretation of what is happening. We have called these guys the Explainers. All in all, 
that is some 50 or 60 further team members. This is no small undertaking.

Today was the Induction Day for the Occaisional Builders and for the first batch of Explainers.

Towards the end of this week and to add a bit of variety to the work 
being undertaken and the skills being developed, we began to practice some of 
the joinery that we would need to perform on the build for real in coming weeks. Our first practice pieces
were to make Peg Tenons on the end of _scrap_ logs. Eventually, we will be making Peg Tenons on some of the 
Roof and Wall Posts. But there are still acres of bark to be stripped.
