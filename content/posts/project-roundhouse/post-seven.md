Build Week 3 underway.

{{<figure src="../week-3-site-view.jpg" caption="A busy site in week 3.">}}

Targets for this week are:

* More bark stripped
* Post holes finished
* Peg tenons on two roof posts to be done
* Slot mortices on thir roof post completed

Mold is not all that far away from Beeston Catsle. This discovery of a fantastic 
golden cape dated to the Bronze Age shows that our Bronze Age breathern were 
not all that disimilar to us in that beautiful, well made stuff was very 
much appreciated. I wonder if the owner of this cape ever visited our Beeston settlement?

The inner bailey and castle ward at the top of Beeston Crag has a ditch. It is not a moat 
and apparently if I ever refer to it again as a moat, English Heritage will dock my privilieges!

A moat has water (or can have), a ditch does not (or can't have).

Over recent times, scrub has grown in the ditch and its is getting difficult to spot 
what an impressive ditch it is. It also looked like a potential source of materials
that would be needed for the walls of the roundhouse. So a clearance party got underway...

Joinery practice continued, with some of us graduating onto more traditional mortice and tenon configurations.

During the week, numerous Ash logs turned up. These would be used to make 
the Roof Beams. But guess what, first of all all 28 of them needed their bark stripping.

During the course of this week, we received a complaint from the Explainers Team that they were 
getting very tired standing around all day, explaining. They pointed out that they really needed 
a place to sit and to recuperate. So, we took one of our practice pieces. A lump of Silver Birch 
that had been used to practice Log Splitting and the use of Bronze Axes and Adzes. We made four legs from
some oak bows and voila!

After all the joinery practice, we now could start on real joints. The three central roof posts needed 
to be prepared with peg tenons and mortices to be able to accept and support the central ring beam 
once raised into place. One Post would have a Peg Tenon, another would have two Peg Tenons taking 
advantage of then nature of that particular Posts configuration and the third would have two 
mortices at suitbale angles. We opted for doing all the joinery exclusively with our Bronze Tools 
and making certain measurements and records whilst doing so to satisfy our archaeological team leader.

As the above photo puts me in mind of a piece of still art, "A Study in Bronze". Here is another arty piccie.

So, week 3 is over. A lot of work done. A lot more yet to do. Last job is to tidy up the site 
and leave things in a good place for the next Build Week, which won't be for a little while now.
