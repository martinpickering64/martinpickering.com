I mentioned in my previous post that the BBC had visited the Roundhouse and filmed a short segment in which 
Luke Winter (the Project Leader), Caroline and I had been interviewed. After several false alarms it has 
finally been aired today on [BBC North West Today](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0005nj6).
