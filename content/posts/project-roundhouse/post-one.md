Back in October 2018, English Heritage's Beeston Castle announced plans to 
build a recreation of a Bronze Age Roundhouse. To be built based on research 
from past archaeological digs using materials from around the castle 
grounds to erect the structure and situated in the victorian quarry section of the site.

They also appealed for people to get involved to help them achieve their dream. I 
couldn't resist and so applied to become a part of the EH Team.

Well, good news I have been accepted as part of the Core Build Team and so will be devoting many days and weeks 
this year on building a Roundhouse and learning about the Bronze Age in Britain.

I hope this will be but the first of a series of Posts tracking the progress of the 
Beeston Castle Roundhouse Project.
