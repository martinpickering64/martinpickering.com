Since the last Build Week at the end of September, a 
small team of builders led by John Hunchback have made a hearth for the Roundhouse.

The clay came from a pit on John's farm and was mixed with grog obtained from the quarry. So once agin, 
very local materials being used.

A building is not really a home without a fire. In this particular case the fire serves more than
a means for warmth, light and cooking. It is a critical part of the building's maintenance and
well being.

The roof design (without a smoke hole) is such that smoke and gases from the fire rise towards the roof. Where
they become trapped by the roof and only slowly manage to percolate through the fibres of the thatch 
to the outside and then to disperse. This has the effect of creating an insert atmosphere close to and through
the thatch, the benefit of which is

- any sparks or embers that rise frm the fire are extinguished before they reach the roof
- any little critters that might think the roof is an attractive home and source of food are discouraged
- the various materials in the roof are preserved

Since the doors were fitted and the walls completed the regular burning of a fire in the house is now
an essential activity. However, before the English Heritage Staff and the Volunteer Team can be allowed to 
set and light fires, the building has to be tested so as to know how fires behave in this new building, 
potential fire starters need to be trained how to prepare, light and maitain a fire is a building such as this
and finally the English Heritage Safety Officer has to be reassured that the requisite safe guards etc. are 
all in place.

This is why we have all gathered together again at the Roundhouse for one more time: Fire Training Day.

Luke Winter returned to the Roundhouse and was our Fire Trainer. The topics diuscussed included:

- preparation and storage of materials
- safety equipment
- safety procedures and evacuation
- when and when not to have a fire
- laying the fire
- starting the fire
- maintaining the fire
- closing the fire down

{{<figure src="../fire-training.jpg" caption="Fire Training was of course conducted around John's brilliant hearth">}}

{{<figure src="../fire-in-the-house.jpg" caption="This is what Fire Training is all about. You just gotta to love a fire.">}}

{{<figure src="../smoke-through-the-roof.jpg">}}

Here we can see the fire and the roof working in partnership, with the smoke slowly percolating through the roof and out.

Obviously, when the fire is first set things get a little smokey, but once we're under 
way the atmosphere clears and being in the house with a fire alight is no problem at all. Just
as it should be.

At the conclusion of the day, we were all qualified EH Fire Starters. Yippee!
