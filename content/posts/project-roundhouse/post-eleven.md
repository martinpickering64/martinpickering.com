Build Week 6 is upon us.

We begin the week finishing the off the remaining parts for the Wall Plate. 

We also manufacture the parts for 
the ring beam that goes on top of the central 3 roof posts.
Whilst doing so, we come to recognise that the peg tenons and and slot motices we have
so carefully fashioned on the top of the biggest Posts are in fact, wrong. So a willing volunteer
was told to clamber up and make the necessary adjustments.

Each of the joints of the Wall Plate that consists of a square tenon and slot mortice (_rather than a peg tenon and round mortice_) 
is further secured using tapered pegs. The pegs are made from Oak and are created on our shavehorse using a draw knife.
As a lot of pegs are required a little industry sprang up to manufacture pegs at a pace so as not to slow the assembly of the 
wall plate.

Unfortunately, due to a misheard communique the first complete set of pegs were to the wrong hole dimension. 
So, a new set was urgently required. Luckily we were by now quite practised at the job and could 
create pegs rapidly.
